\title{Estimate the distance between two neighboring spots}
\usage{
compute_neighborhood_radius(sce, scale.factor = 1.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment (must include row, col, imagerow, imagecol 
in colData)}

\item{scale.factor}{Scale estimated L1 difference up by this amount.}
}
\value{
double radius
}
\description{
Fit linear models between each image pixel coordinate and its corresponding
array coordinate to estimate the pixel distance between two spots along
each axis. Add these distances to estimate the L1 distance between two
spots, then add a small buffer.
